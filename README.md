# Convert and Optimize YOLOv8 with OpenVINO - Dog Detectorâ„¢

This tutorial explains how to convert and optimize the [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/) PyTorch model with OpenVINO and do Dog Detection from image


## Notebook Contents

This tutorial demonstrates step-by-step instructions on how to run and optimize PyTorch Yolo V8 with OpenVINO.

The tutorial consists of the following steps:
- Prepare the PyTorch model.
- Download and prepare the dataset.
- Validate the original model.
- Convert the PyTorch model to OpenVINO IR.
- Validate the converted model.
- Run the converted model to detect dog.

## Installation Instructions

This is a self-contained example that relies solely on its own code.</br>
We recommend  running the notebook in a virtual environment. You only need a Jupyter server to start.
For details, please refer to [Installation Guide](../../README.md).
